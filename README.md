Are you ready to race against time and prove your reaction skills? Buckle up for the most thrilling challenge on Google Play Store - Reacto! 

**Lights** - Can you beat the lights? In this heart-pounding game, you'll face 5 cunningly elusive red lights. They'll tease you, one by one, before going all-white. Your mission? Tap the screen at the speed of light to record your reaction time down to the millisecond! 

**Color** - Can you match the colors with the speed of a chameleon's tongue? Hold your breath, press, and wait as colors flash before your eyes. The moment that screen turns green, it's time to let go! Race against time, lift your finger, and prove you're the fastest color chaser in town! 

**Speed** - Ready, set, go! It's a tap-tastic race against the clock. Navigate through a grid of circles as they randomly light up red. Your fingers need to be nimble as you tap your way to glory. Can you set a new speed record in just 20 seconds? 

**Sound** - Listen up, sharp-eared warriors! This game is all about precision timing. A countdown from 3, a random sound, and then BAM! Tap the screen lightning-fast to clock your reaction time down to the millisecond. The sound's the trigger, and you're the maestro! 

But that's not all! Your scores from these thrilling mini-games will be totaled to determine your grand score. Get ready to climb the racing class divisions and take on your friends and family for ultimate bragging rights! 

Prepare for epic battles of wits and speed as you laugh, compete, and strive to top the charts with your loved ones. Reacto is not just a game; it's a hilarious, heart-pounding, and downright addictive experience that will have you hooked for hours on end!

Remember, scores below 150 milliseconds in any of the reaction games won't be recorded because, well, we're all only human! And if you dare to tap too early, the game will call you out for trying to cheatâ€”no shortcuts in Reacto!
